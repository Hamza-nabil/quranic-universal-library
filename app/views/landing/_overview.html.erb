      Islamic projects are built upon the same universal resources:
    </div>
    <div>
      the Quran, its translations, its tafsir, recitations of it,
    </div>
    <div>
      related content and data.

             refines how to represent the Quran digitally and catalogues many
        of these resources in a way that they can be easily integrated.

      To make it easier for everyone in the Islamic development ecosystem
      to build their own projects without redoing all of this work, we
      have open-sourced and made publicly available many of these
      resources along with the tools necessary to interact with and
      explore them.

      This toolbox is primarily geared towards other Muslim developers.
